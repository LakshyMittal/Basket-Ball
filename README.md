# Basketball Pose Detection

## Overview
Basketball Pose Detection is a computer vision project designed to analyze basketball player movements using pose detection techniques. The project extracts frames from videos, detects player poses, and analyzes their stances and movements.

## Features
- **Frame Extraction:** Captures frames from video input.
- **Pose Detection:** Identifies player movements using OpenPose/MediaPipe.
- **Pose Analysis:** Evaluates player stance, technique, and movement patterns.
- **Future Enhancements:** Potential improvements for better accuracy and real-time tracking.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Libraries Used:**
  - OpenCV
  - MediaPipe/OpenPose
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Pandas
  - TensorFlow/Keras (if ML is involved)

## System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python Version:** 3.8+
- **Hardware Requirements:**
  - Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for large videos)
  - GPU (Optional but recommended for faster processing)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/basketball-pose-detection.git
   cd basketball-pose-detection
   ```

   ```

## Usage
1. Place your basketball game footage in the `input_videos/` folder.
2. Run the script to extract frames and analyze poses.
3. Output results will be saved in `output/`.

 Future Scope
- Implement AI/ML models for motion analysis.
- Improve accuracy and real-time tracking.
- Integrate with mobile applications for player feedback.
- Add a GUI for easier user interaction.
