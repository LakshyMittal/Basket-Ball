# Basketball Pose Detection

## Overview
Basketball Pose Detection is a computer vision project designed to analyze basketball player movements using pose detection techniques. The project extracts frames from videos, detects player poses, and analyzes their stances and movements.

## Important Message for Users
1. **Download Python 3.9.13**
2. **Camera Configuration:** I have changed the camera number in step 6. I set it to `1` as I am using an external webcam, but if your device has a built-in webcam, set it to `0`.

## Steps to Set Up the Project
1. **Make a folder named `Basketball`.**
2. **Create two subfolders named `Dribbling` and `Shooting`.**
3. **Save all relevant videos in each folder.**
4. **Run every step of the project and make changes by referring to the "Important Message for Users" section.**

## Features
- **Frame Extraction:** Captures frames from video input.
- **Pose Detection:** Identifies player movements using OpenPose/MediaPipe.
- **Pose Analysis:** Evaluates player stance, technique, and movement patterns.
- **Future Enhancements:** Potential improvements for better accuracy and real-time tracking.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Libraries Used:**
  - OpenCV
  - MediaPipe/OpenPose
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Pandas
  - TensorFlow/Keras (if ML is involved)

## System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python Version:** 3.8+
- **Hardware Requirements:**
  - Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for large videos)
  - GPU (Optional but recommended for faster processing)



## Usage
1. Place your basketball game footage in the `input_videos/` folder.
2. Run the script to extract frames and analyze poses.
3. Output results will be saved in `output/`.
